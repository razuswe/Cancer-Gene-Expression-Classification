# Cancer Gene Expression Classification Using Mahcine Learning
In this notebook I will examine a small gene expression dataset, attempting to classify leukemia patients into one of two classes. This dataset comes from a proof-of-concept study published in 1999 by Golub et al. It showed how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes. These data were used to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
